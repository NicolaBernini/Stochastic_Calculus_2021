The purpose of this Repo is to re-organize some old notes of mine about Stochastic Calculus, written when at Physics I was studying Quantitative Finance. 

The idea is to present topics with an informal and communicative approach, relying on analogies and intuitions. 

This is a differentiation point with respect to the typical academic material that is certainly more rigorous and formal. 

However, my mathematical notation is probably a bit heavy, this is for the sake of clarity.  

Topics 

# 1. Foundations 

## 1.1 [Brownian Motion](Brownian_Motion)

## 1.2 [Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE)](SDE)
